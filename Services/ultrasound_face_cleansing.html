            <p>Deep face cleansing is a basic procedure which precludes any skin care program.
                Daily facial washing only deals with superficial impurities and makeup removal
                without getting rid of dead cells that prevent oxygenation of the skin and delay the
                delivery of nutrients into the deeper skin layers. This manifests as uneven, greyish
                skin colour, keratosis (thickening of the parts of skin), reduced skin tone and its
                laxity.</p>
            <p>Ultrasound face cleansing allows to resolve these issues and return healthy, fresh
                and youthful skin. Due to the gentle nature of this treatment, it is suitable even
                for sensitive skin.</p>
            <p>Positive effects of the ultrasound on the human body were discovered in the
                beginning of XX century. In 1951 ultrasound found its use in medicine, whilst first
                ultrasound machine for face cleansing was produced in 1997. Since then, this
                procedure gained popularity and now in widespread use amongst men and
                women of various ages.</p>
            <p><b>What is ultrasound face cleansing?</b></p>
            <p>Scrubber is a special tool that is used during the cleansing session. It generates
                high frequency sound waves that work only on skin layers without having any
                effect on internal organs. Due to its effects, dead cells peel off easily. This also
                produces a specific massage effect that improves the blood flow, skin tone and
                its elasticity. Metabolism is stimulated which promotes mechanisms of cell
                renewal. This results in deep cleansing and creates even skin tone. Skin looks
                clean, fresh and glowing. This is a non-invasive method of skin rejuvenation and
                does not cause any skin damage.</p>

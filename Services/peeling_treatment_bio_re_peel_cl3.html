            <p>An innovative treatment peel that dissolves bonds between cells that carefully
                removes the top layer of skin revealing the glowing smooth layer underneath.
                While exfoliating the skin surface, it also stimulates the production of collagen and

                <h2 class="price-laptop">Price: $150</h2>
                <p>Where Biostimulation amplifies the fibroblasts to significantly improve the texture
                    with instant results; Revitalization is responsible for healthy skin formation. Peeling
                    provides skin renewal.</p>
                <p><b>To achieve all of these, peel contains a blend of the following:</b></p>

                        </li>

                    regular facial treatments; BioRePeel’’s antibacterial effect also helps with acne and
                    complications associated with it.
                    We love this peel for its amazing immediate results, safety, and extremely short
                    downtime.</p>
